							<h2><a href="#about" id="about" class="heading">About me</a></h2>
							<p>My name is Christopher Albert tan, an Indonesian student currently studying Computer Science in Langara, Vancouver. 
								I was born in March 12, 2002. In Summer 2022, I will be entering the Software Systems department in Simon Fraser University. 
							</p>
							<p>Throughout 2021, I have gained a lot of new experiences that has led me to become the person I am today, from 
								learning to live alone, to meeting new friends with the same goals. Despite keeping to myself most of the time, 
								the communites and the people I have met along the way has given me a lot of confidence and joy in this chapter of my life. 
							<p>Despite starting of with close to no experience, the few months that I have spent in college has helped me develop 
								my interest in programming and computer software. I feel like there is so much more I need to learn and this website will 
								be a place for me to show some of my work and dump some of my ideas.
							</p>

							<h2><a href="#plans "id="plans" class="heading">Plans for the future</a></h2>
							<p>Throughout college, my main has been to get into Simon Fraser University. Now that I have my letter of
								acceptance, the last step towards that goal is finishing up my studies in Langara. I have learned a great deal 
								there but I still got work to do in order to ensure I am able to maintain my academic standing. For now, I 
								my goal is to prepare myself for University and to enroll myself in the coop program provided there.
							</p>
							<p>Aside from academics, I would like to also keep working on my hobbies. Playing the piano gives me a lot
								of joy and I would love to be able to keep practicing so I can strive to be a better pianist. Another 
								personal goal I had was to learn a new language, but that comes after I improve my chinese. It has always
								been a dream of mine to bu multilungual and my goal is to be fluent in at least 4 different languages
