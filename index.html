							<h2><a id="about" class="link">About me</a></h2>
							<p>My name is Christopher Albert tan, an Indonesian student currently studying Computer Science in Langara, Vancouver. 
								I was born in March 12, 2002, 
							</p>
							<p>Throughout fall 2021, I have gained a lot of new experiences that has led me to become the person I am today, from 
								learning to live alone, to meeting new friends with the same goals. Despite keeping to myself most of the time, 
								the communites and the people I have met along the way has given me a lot of confidence and joy in this chpater of my life. 
							<p>Despite starting of with close to no experience, the few months that I have spent in college has helped me develop 
								my interest in programming and computer software. I feel like there is so much more I need to learn and this website will 
								be a place for me to show some of my work and dump some of my ideas.

							<h2><a id="plans" class="link">Plans for the future</a></h2>
							<p>My main goal right now is to learn and work as hard as I can while in college so I can transfer to
								a university by next summer, preferably to SFU. I have heard great things about their co-op program 
								from the people around me and I am looking to forward to take part! In terms of selecting a field
								in computer sciece, there are several that I am interested in. Between Computer graphics, software development,
								AI, and UI UX, I hope I can major in one of those fields by the time I get to University.
							</p>
							<p>Aside from academics, I would like to also keep working on my hobbies. Playing the piano gives me a lot
								of joy and I would love to be able to keep practicing so I can strive to be a better pianist. Another 
								personal goal I had was to learn a new language, but that comes after I improve my chinese. It has always
								been a dream of mine to bu multilungual and my goal is to be fluent in at least 4 different languages
