1. My website is a short biography of who I am, seperated into three sections, which are about, projects, and section. It will be more comfortably viewed through mobile devices, or when the window is size is around half a screen. I have provided a wireframe, a short bio, 5 hyperlinks to other social media apps I'm using and a custom favicon. The projects section also includes screenshots of different programs I've worked on.
2. A favicon is a small icon that represents your website. It shows up next to your website name on top of the browser's header. It serves as a way for users to easily identify your website, which is especially useful when multiple tabs are open.
3. Github pages is a service that allows you to host a website directly through your github repository.
4. Github actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your build, test and deployment pipeline through your github repository. It allows you to create workflow that builds and tests from every pull requests, pushes, and commits.
5. I used HTML to make the website, and CSS to style it. I chose these because they are what I am most familiar with when it comes to making a website. In addition, html is supported by all browsers, making the website easily accessible for any user. Css is used because it allows the html portion to be more focused on the content, while also allowing me to style the html more freely through a seperate file in the form of css.
